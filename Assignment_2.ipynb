In reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. Its goal is to maximize the total reward.It is defined as an event, that occurs because of specific behavior. It increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior and impacts positively on the action taken by the agent."
