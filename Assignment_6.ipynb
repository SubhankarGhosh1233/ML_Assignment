    "Ans:- If you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem. For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better . The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and you evaluate only a few reasonable models. "

    "Ans:- K-fold cross-validation approach divides the input dataset into K groups of samples of equal sizes. These samples are called folds. For each learning set, the prediction function uses k-1 folds, and the rest of the folds are used for the test set. This approach is a very popular CV approach because it is easy to understand, and the output is less biased than other methods."

Bootstrapping it is not as strong as Cross validation when it is used for model validation."
